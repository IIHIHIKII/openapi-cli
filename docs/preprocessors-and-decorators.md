# Preprocessors and Decorators


## Rationale

There might appear such situation, when the input data should be mutated before or after validation and/or bundling. For this case, you might want to run custom preprocessors before or decorators after bundling.

## Preprocessors

> NOTE: this feature is experimental. Mutating OpenAPI definition may break codeframes in errors.

## Decorators

TBD
